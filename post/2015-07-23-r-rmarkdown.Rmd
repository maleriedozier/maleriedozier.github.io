# R Studio and Python

R Studio and Python can communicate together and can perform similar functions. Below is an example of using R Studio and Python to achieve similar results. Using R Studio, one can switch from R to Python easily. 

Example:

```{r cars}
data("quakes")
summary(quakes)
median(quakes$depth)
```
```{python}
import pandas as pd
quakes=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/quakes.csv",index_col=0)
import numpy as np
quakes["depth"].median()

```


```
